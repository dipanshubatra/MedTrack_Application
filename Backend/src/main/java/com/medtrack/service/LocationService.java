/**
 * Facility location tree management and per-asset location assignment/history (issue #745).
 *
 * <p>The tree is hospital-scoped: every operation resolves the caller's hospital from their
 * principal and refuses nodes belonging to any other tenant.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two tables describe where an asset is, and they answer different questions.
 * {@code equipment.location_id} is where the asset is <em>now</em>;
 * {@code equipment_location_history} is the append-only log of everywhere it has <em>been</em>.
 * Occupancy checks read the first; the second is audit and is never treated as evidence of current
 * occupancy - see {@link #deleteLocation}.</p>

     * <p>"Empty" means no asset is standing there now, which is
     * {@link EquipmentRepository#countByLocationId(Long)}. The guard used to count rows in
     * {@code equipment_location_history} instead, and that is a different question - it counts the
     * assets that were <em>ever</em> placed there - so it was wrong in both directions:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code EquipmentService} sets {@code equipment.location} on both create and update
     *       without writing a history row, so every asset placed through the equipment form left the
     *       history table empty for its node. The guard passed and the location was deleted out from
     *       under live equipment. {@code equipment.location_id} carries no foreign key constraint -
     *       V15 adds it as a plain nullable column - so nothing downstream caught it either; the
     *       assets were simply left pointing at a row that no longer existed.</li>
     *   <li>Moving an asset from one node to another leaves the first node's history row in place,
     *       because that is what a movement log is for. The emptied node then counted as occupied
     *       forever and could never be deleted.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>History is deliberately not consulted and deliberately not deleted. It is the record of what
     * happened, it has to outlive the node it refers to, and it now does -
     * {@link EquipmentLocationHistory#getLocation()} reads as {@code null} for a deleted location
     * rather than failing to load.</p>
     *
     * <p>Archived assets do not block the delete either - holding a node hostage for a soft-deleted
     * record would be the same trap as the history check - but their pointer is cleared on the way
     * out so a later restore does not resurrect a reference to a location that is gone.</p>
