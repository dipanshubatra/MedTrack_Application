/**
 * Scheduled driver for warranty-expiry alerts (issue #703).
 *
 * <p>Runs daily and raises an operations event - broadcast to the hospital's WebSocket
 * subscribers via {@link EventPublisherService} and listed in the event feed - for every asset
 * that enters one of the alert windows: 90, 60 or 30 days before the warranty ends, and on the
 * day of expiry itself. Assets already past expiry are not re-alerted: the EXPIRED status badge
 * on the inventory pages covers them, and daily spam would drown the feed.</p>
 *
 * <p>Alerting is idempotent per asset and window: the threshold is recorded in the event detail,
 * and an existing event for the same asset and threshold suppresses a duplicate, so the job is
 * safe to run repeatedly and a missed day simply folds the asset into the nearest window.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Which assets are eligible (issue #943)</h2>
 *
 * <p>Only assets still in the operating fleet are alerted on. A warranty date on a
 * {@link EquipmentStatus#RETIRED} or {@link EquipmentStatus#DISPOSED} asset is historical record,
 * not something anyone can act on: the device has left the estate through the decommissioning
 * workflow and the warranty cannot be renewed, so a CRITICAL event about it is pure noise in a feed
 * whose value depends on every entry being actionable. That noise is also permanent, because the
 * per-asset/per-threshold suppression marker gets written on the first run.</p>
 *
 * <p>The eligibility rule lives in {@link EquipmentStatus#DECOMMISSIONED} and is applied by the
 * database in {@link EquipmentRepository#findAlertableByWarrantyExpiryBetween}, which also narrows
 * the scan to the 90-day horizon the thresholds actually cover. The previous implementation loaded
 * the entire {@code equipment} table across every tenant on each run and filtered in Java.</p>
