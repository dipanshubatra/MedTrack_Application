/**
 * Depreciation and replacement-value maths for the equipment fleet.
 *
 * <p>Book value is always floored at zero - an asset never shows a negative value on the books -
 * and an asset without a purchase cost has no depreciation: its book value equals its cost (null
 * or zero), exactly as if the finance fields were never filled in.</p>
 *
 * <p>Elapsed time is measured in fractional years ({@code days / 365.25}) so book value changes
 * smoothly day to day instead of jumping once a year.</p>
 *
 * <p>There are two entry points into the same maths. {@link #bookValue} and
 * {@link #projectedReplacementCost} are the {@code BigDecimal} valuation used by the
 * {@code Equipment} entity's transient getters, where money must not lose precision. The
 * {@code calculate*} helpers below are the salvage-aware view used by the financial analytics
 * endpoints, whose DTOs carry doubles. Both share {@link #elapsedYears} and the same rounding, so
 * the dashboard and the entity can never disagree about the same asset.</p>
