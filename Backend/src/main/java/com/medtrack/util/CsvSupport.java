 * <p>Replaces the hand-rolled string handling in {@code EquipmentService}, which had three
 * defects:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>The writer never quoted anything.</strong> Field values were concatenated with
 *       commas, so an asset named {@code "Ventilator, Portable"} produced eight fields under a
 *       seven-column header and shifted every subsequent column for that row. A {@code "} or a
 *       newline in any field corrupted the file structurally.</li>
 *   <li><strong>The parser dropped escaped quotes.</strong> It toggled a boolean on every
 *       {@code "} and never emitted the character, so the RFC 4180 escape {@code ""} toggled twice
 *       and vanished: {@code "Monitor 15"" Display"} parsed as {@code Monitor 15 Display}.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Neither side neutralised formulas.</strong> A value beginning {@code =}, {@code +},
 *       {@code -} or {@code @} is evaluated as a formula by Excel, LibreOffice and Google Sheets
 *       when the exported file is opened (CWE-1236).</li>
