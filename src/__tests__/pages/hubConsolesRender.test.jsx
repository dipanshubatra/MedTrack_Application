// Every hub console must render.
//
// Why this file exists
// --------------------
// Thirteen hub consoles rendered nothing but the ErrorBoundary fallback on `main`. The extraction of
// the page-local UI primitives into src/components/common removed each page's local `StatCard`,
// `SearchBox`, `InfoRow`, `Modal`, `Badge`, `TabsBar`, `SEVERITY_META` and friends, and never added
// the imports that replace them. Every one of those identifiers was a free variable, so the first
// render threw:
//
//   ReferenceError: SEVERITY_META is not defined
//     at ColdChainCommandHub (src/pages/coldchain/ColdChainCommandHub.jsx:977:49)
//
// Three of the thirteen had a test file and went red. The other ten had none, so they shipped broken
// and stayed broken: a page that throws on render is not distinguishable from a page nobody looked
// at, and nothing in the suite looked at them.
//
// The gap is what this file closes. It is deliberately shallow - render the console, assert the
// heading is on screen - because the defect class it guards is "the module cannot render at all",
// and depth buys nothing against that. A single smoke assertion per console would have caught all
// thirteen. Ten of them had no assertion of any kind.
//
// The three consoles that already have their own suites are included anyway. They are cheap, and
// listing all thirteen in one place makes the set auditable: a new console added to the registry
// without an entry here is visible in review, where a missing separate test file is not.

/**
 * The thirteen consoles the extraction broke, each with the heading it renders.
 *
 * `heading` is a substring rather than an exact string: the headings carry an ampersand written as
 * `&amp;` in the source, which the DOM normalises to `&`, and several are split across a line break
 * by the formatter. Matching a distinctive fragment is stable against both.
