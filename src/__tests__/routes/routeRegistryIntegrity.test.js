// Regression suite for the invariants of src/routes/routeRegistry.js.
//
// Why this file exists
// --------------------
// The registry is the single source of truth for SPA routing, and every one of the four defects
// below reached `main` at least once:
//
//   1. `const BiomedicalAiGovernancePage = ...` was written twice in the same module scope. That is
//      a hard SyntaxError, not a warning: the module never evaluated, so `npm run build` produced
//      no bundle and twenty-two of the thirty-seven test files failed at import time with
//      "Identifier 'BiomedicalAiGovernancePage' has already been declared" before a single
//      assertion ran. The suite was red for reasons that had nothing to do with the code under
//      test, which is the worst possible failure mode for a test suite.
//
//   2. Six page keys - quantum-kms, confidential-compute, ctem, clinical-ai,
//      biomedical-ai-governance and a second confidential-compute/ctem pair - were declared two or
//      three times over, each declaration carrying a *different* secondary slug. PAGE_TO_ROUTE is
//      built with a reduce that overwrites, so the last declaration silently won; SLUG_TO_PAGE is
//      built the same way, so /enclaves, /ctem-hub and /kms-vault resolved to whichever entry came
//      last rather than being unreachable in an obvious way. Nothing about that is visible at a
//      glance in a 130-entry array.
//
//   3. Two page keys - icu-vitals-telemetry and icu-vitals - rendered the same component from four
//      slugs across two entries, so the "canonical slug" that buildPath() returns depended on which
//      of the two keys a caller happened to use.
//
//   4. Nine finished hub consoles (regulatory audit, pharmacovigilance, surgical robotics, lab
//      automation, pediatric NICU, medication supply, telehealth monitoring, genomic trials,
//      hospital command orchestration) existed as page components under src/pages/ with no registry
//      entry at all. They were linked from navigation and rendered the 404 page.
//
// scripts/check-routes.js already catches (2), (3) and (4) from `prebuild`, and check-syntax.js
// catches (1). Both are static scans that run outside the test suite, which means a contributor
// running `npm test` locally gets a green tick on a registry that cannot be built. These tests
// close that gap: they exercise the *evaluated* module, so they also cover the resolution
// behaviour - resolvePath, buildPath, checkAccess, resolveEffectivePage - that a static scan
// cannot reach.
