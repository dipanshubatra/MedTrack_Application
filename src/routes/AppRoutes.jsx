/**
 * Renders whichever page the registry resolves for `currentPage`.
 *
 * This file used to carry a 130-line `switch` listing every route by hand, in parallel with a
 * `routeMap` object in App.jsx and an import list at the top of this file. Nothing kept the three
 * consistent and they had drifted badly: `keyvault-security` appeared as a `case` label twice in
 * the same switch, `microsegmentation` appeared in two separate case groups so the second was
 * unreachable, and the `ProtectedRoute` helper the switch called was deleted by a merge while every
 * one of its ~30 call sites stayed - leaving a bare `return` statement floating between the
 * component's body and the switch, which is what stopped the whole bundle from parsing.
 *
 * Route information now lives in exactly one place - routeRegistry.js - and this component is the
 * generic renderer for it, so a new console cannot be half-registered.
 *
 * Access control is applied here, once, rather than per route:
 *
 *   - an unknown slug resolves to the 404 page;
 *   - an unauthenticated visitor to a protected route gets the login screen (App.jsx derives layout
 *     chrome from the same `resolveEffectivePage` call, so the two cannot disagree);
 *   - a signed-in user whose role is not on the route's allow-list gets the Access Denied page.
