/**
 * Validates src/routes/routeRegistry.js against the pages that actually exist on disk.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * Route information used to live in three hand-maintained places — the `routeMap` object in
 * App.jsx, the `switch` in AppRoutes.jsx, and the import list above it — with nothing keeping them
 * consistent. The drift that accumulated:
 *
 *   - `KeyVaultSecurityPage` and `MicrosegmentationPage` were rendered but never imported, an
 *     uncaught ReferenceError that the ErrorBoundary turns into a blank screen;
 *   - `case "keyvault-security"` and `case "microsegmentation"` each appeared twice, so the second
 *     was dead code and `/microsegmentation` silently rendered the ZTNA page instead;
 *   - `routeMap` declared `help` twice and `microsegmentation` twice with *different* targets, and
 *     in an object literal the last one silently wins;
 *   - fourteen security consoles existed as page components with no route at all.
 *
 * Collapsing the three lists into one registry removes the drift by construction. This script
 * closes the remaining gap: it fails the build when the registry itself is inconsistent, or when a
 * page component under src/pages/ is never registered. It used to audit only src/pages/auth/ -
 * the directory that had already bit us - but that let a whole second class of orphans through:
 * pages outside src/pages/auth (public marketing pages, hospital and supplier pages) that existed
 * as files, were linked to from the footer, navbar or cookie banner, and still resolved to the
 * 404 page because nobody had added them to the registry. So the audit now walks every *.jsx
 * file under src/pages/ (test files excluded) and requires each one to be either registered or
 * listed in UNROUTED_PAGES below with a reason.
 *
 * It works by static analysis rather than by importing the registry, so it needs no React runtime,
 * no JSDOM and no test framework, and it runs in well under a second from `prebuild`.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/check-routes.js
